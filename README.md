# Hangman Game

The computer chooses a random word and asks you to guess the word. 
For each wrong letter you choose, the hanging man gets completed one step at a time. 
If the hanging man gets completed, you lose.
Else if you manage to guess all the correct letters before the hanging man gets completed, tada! You win!
